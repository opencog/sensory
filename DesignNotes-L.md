Memory, Assembly, Understanding
===============================
Below follows some ruminations on a simple design that could provide a
verbal (text) interface to complex strutural systems, as well as a
rudimentary form of memory. It is based on using an LLM, such as ollama,
to generate vector embeddings of text snippets; these vector embeddings
can then be associated with matching structural (symbolic) entities. It
might offer a simple way forward past some earlier design blockages
encountered in this project.

In this perspective, the LLM is treated as a natural language API into
non-verbal systems; the "thinking" happens non-verbally, while the text
LLM provides a way of manipulating, controlling and working with th
non-verbal elements.

A "memory" architecture

The core archtiecture builds on the conventional notion of a context
