; filesys.scm -- filesystem demo
;
; Demo the introspection (reflection) API for file system navigation.
; The goal is to demonstrate how an agent can find out what an API
; looks like, for some sensory environment, and what the motor commands
; are, to move around in that environment. The "environment" here
; happens to be the file system. The motor commands correspond to
; a small subset of the traditional unix filesystem commands. An agent
; can discover what these are, by puttering around in the API. This demo
; shows how.
;
; Under construction. Uses ideas sketched in the README in
; opencog/atoms/irc/README.md
;
; As you go through this demo, you will notice how horribly complicated
; it is. The description of the sensory environment uses Sections with
; a bunch of Connectors on them, describing the actions and perceptions
; that are possible in this environment. The demo below attempts to
; manually parse (by hand!) all of these connectors, and hook things up
; to them. Ouch! Parsing is the job of Link Grammar. What we really want
; to do here is to have Link Grammar to take a look at the sensory
; environment, say "a hah, this is really easy: I see one 'word' with
; four disjuncts on it, let me hook some stuff up to those connectors"
; where the stuff being hooked up will be various sensory-processing
; 'words' or various action-taking 'words'.
;
; Anyway, that's the general plan. The details remain obscure.

; -----------------------------------------------------------
; Preliminary setup.

; Open filesystem node, and anchor it.
(cog-execute!
	(SetValue
		(Anchor "xplor") (Predicate "fsys")
		(Open (Type 'FileSysStream) (Sensory "file:///tmp"))))

; In principle, the agent should do the above after discovery.
; For now, for this demo, just hard-code it, as above.

; -----------------------------------------------------------
; Demo the basic commands as a "human" would use them.
; These are, of course, hopelessly verbose for a human, but that
; is beside the point; the goal is to have a self-describing
; interface. In some programming languages, this is called
; "introspection" or "reflection".
(cog-execute! (Write (ValueOf (Anchor "xplor") (Predicate "fsys"))
	(Item "pwd")))

(cog-execute! (Write (ValueOf (Anchor "xplor") (Predicate "fsys"))
	(Item "ls")))

(cog-execute! (Write (ValueOf (Anchor "xplor") (Predicate "fsys"))
	(List (Item "cd") (Item "file:///home"))))

(cog-execute! (Write (ValueOf (Anchor "xplor") (Predicate "fsys"))
	(Item "ls")))

; --------------------------------------------------------
; Now lets look at how the API for the above is represented.
; This builds a crude stimulus-reponse pipeline in scheme.
; Ultimately, we want such pipes to be in Atomese, not scheme,
; but it is easier to poke at bit bits and pieces with scheme.

; Get the description of what this sensory device provides.
(define fsys-descr
	(cog-execute! (Lookat (Type 'FileSysStream))))

; Print it. It should be a ChoiceLink of a bunch of sections.
fsys-descr

; Brute-force; just get the first choice. It's a Section with
; a ConnectorSeq on it.
(define some-cmd-descr (cog-value-ref fsys-descr 0))

; Take a look at what it is.
some-cmd-descr

; Pull the connector sequence out of it.
(define conn-seq (cog-value-ref some-cmd-descr 1))

; Convert the connector sequence to a scheme list.
(define conn-list (cog-value->list conn-seq))

; Brute-force walk over the connectors, and extract the ones
; that encode a command. These are the ones having (Sex "command").
; The sensory data have (Sex "reply") and we ignore this, here.
(define cmd-seq
	(filter-map
		(lambda (cnctr)
			(if (equal? (gar cnctr) (Sex "command"))
				(gdr cnctr)
				#f))
		conn-list))

; Now that we have all of the pieces, assemble a runnable command.
; This should have the form of (Write (ValueOf ...) (Item "ls"))
; because the Section for "ls" just happens to be the first Section
; returned in the ChoiceLink, and that Section also stated that
; a WriteLink should be used to perform that action. The location
; of the sensory stream, that we have to insert ourselves, as the
; first argument to Write.
(define some-cmd
	(cog-execute!
		(LinkSignature
			(car cmd-seq)
			(DontExec (ValueOf (Anchor "xplor") (Predicate "fsys")))
			(cdr cmd-seq))))

; Take a look at what we got. Make sure it is in the expected form.
some-cmd

; Run it. This assumes the sensory stream was opened, earlier, with
; the OpenLink (near top of this file).
(cog-execute! some-cmd)

; --------------------------------------------------------
; Repeat the above, but this time in Atomese.
; This builds a crude stimulus-reponse pipeline.
; Under construction, broken.

; Lets take a look at the landscape, again
(cog-execute! (Lookat (Type 'FileSysStream)))

; The landscape arrives as a ChoiceLink, of possible things to do.
; This makes it awkward for later processing stages, so unwrap the
; ChoiceLink and discard it.
(cog-execute!
	(Filter
		(LinkSignature (Type 'Choice) (Glob "$x"))
		(Lookat (Type 'FileSysStream))))

; Extract the command, and it's argument, and then the rest.
; The result is a simplified form of the description. We need
; the simplified form to built the processing pipe.
(cog-execute!
	(Filter
		(Section
			(Type 'Item)  ; Ignore whatever text is here.
			(ConnectorSeq
				(Connector
					(Sex "command")
					(Variable "$cmd"))   ; Get the actual command
				(Connector
					(Sex "command")
					(Variable "$arg"))   ; Get the argument to the command
				(Glob "$rest")))        ; Get the rest.

		; The unwrappped ChoiceLink, from above.
		(Filter
			(LinkSignature (Type 'Choice) (Glob "$x"))
			(Lookat (Type 'FileSysStream)))))

; Look for commands that do not require any additional arguments.
(cog-execute!
	(Filter
		(Section
			(Type 'Item)
			(ConnectorSeq
				(Connector
					(Sex "command")
					(Variable "$cmd"))
				(Connector
					(Sex "command")
					(Variable "$arg"))
				(Connector
					(Sex "reply")
					(TypeCoInh 'Atom))))  ; also (Variable "$foo")
		(Filter
			(LinkSignature (Type 'Choice) (Glob "$x"))
			(Lookat (Type 'FileSysStream)))))

; XXX Notice how painfully complicated all of the above is. Ugh!
; What we *really* want to do is the use Link Grammar to perform
; all of the connector matching for us, automatically. All that
; the above demos are doing is reinventing Link Grammar, but in
; Atomese. Yikes!


; --------------------------------------------------------

; Throws because wrong number of args. XXX FIXME
(cog-execute! (Lookat (Type 'TextFileStream)))

; --------------------------------------------------------
; The End! That's All, Folks!
