Structure Learning
==================
New set for notes concerning the learning of structure. Different
chapter than the earlier notes.

Start with a recap of the earlier proect for learning structure.

Recap of Previous Learn Project
-------------------------------
The first attempt at structure learning is the github project
https://github.com/opencog/learn and perhaps this diary entry belongs
there. However, I want to incorporate the new ideas here, and so, for
now, this chapter is here.
