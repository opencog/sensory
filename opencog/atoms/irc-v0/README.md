Internet Relay Chat
===================
IRC chat API. Can connect to IRC, read, and write. Works but still
a rough prototype.

Examples
--------
See the [irc-api.scm](../../../examples/irc-api.scm) and
[irc-echo-bot.scm](../../../examples/irc-echo-bot.scm) demos.

Design Ideas
------------
The general thought process leading up to this stufff is in
[Design Notes Part B](../../../DesignNotes-B.md) What it says there
is probably a correct-ish description of how the stuff in here actually
works.
