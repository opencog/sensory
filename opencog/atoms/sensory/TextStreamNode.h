/**
 * TextStreamNode provides a virtual base class for objects that will
 * be writing (utf8 or ascii) text. It consists of some utility methods
 * that unpack, unwrap an assortment of Atoms, Values and TextStreams that
 * might occur that have text flowing on them.
 *
 * Basically, it is a conversion shim that allows a loose assortment of
 * almost anything to be streamed in, converting it into c++ strings
 * that are easy to handle to the actual writer.
 *
 * This API is experimental.
