# This imports all the python wrappers for atom creation.

# Step one: force the C++ shared lib ctor to run and report
# the new Atom type to the atomspace nameserver.
sensory_types_init()

# Step two: Ask python to rebuild the list of Atom Types that it knows
# about.  This adds new attributes to the python .types class.
regenerate_types()

# Step three: declare some wrappers to make python easier to use.
