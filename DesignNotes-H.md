Vector Similarity
-----------------
The previous file [DesignNotes-G](DesignNotes-G.md) pondered a general
problem of type conversion, needed to deal with mildly incompatible
streams. It uses `EqualLink` as the base example.

A different variant on this problem is that of vector similarity.
Consider a search pattern that isolates a collection of vectors,
and one wishes to compare two vectors, using any one of the conventional
comparison measures: Hamming Distance, Jacquard similarity, Cosine
Distance, Mutual Information, Conditional Probability, etc. Given
two vectors, these each produce a single floating point number, or
possibly more than one.

The goal is to write an agent that can perform this compare. It's an
"agent" because it self-describes it's own input types, and its output
types as well: the format descriptions are not external to the agent,
but are intrinsic to it. That is, the agent presents a list of
connnectors that are joinable.

### Data sources
This agent needs to get input from somewhere. But where?  Earlier
examples included IRC, xterms and the file system. Now consider another
canonical example: the query pattern. Two questions arise:
 * How to describe the data generated by the query?
 * How to turn the query into an agent?

The filesys.scm demo says "use Lookat":
```
(cog-execute! (Lookat (Type 'FileSysStream))
(cog-execute! (Lookat (Type 'FooBarStream))
```
This works great, if there is an actual Atomese `FooBarStream` type
implemented as a C++ object, having a `OutputStream::describe()` method
on it.

What if the device is itself written in Atomese (such as a Query) or
what if the device is some half-assembled network? What do we do then?






To open, earlier examples said "use Open":
```
   (Open (Type 'TerminalStream))
   (Open (Type 'IRChatStream)
      (SensoryNode "irc://botty@irc.libera.chat:6667"))
   (Open (Type 'TextFileStream)
      (SensoryNode "file:///tmp/demo.txt"))

```
